Here I will extend a classic ATARI asteroid shooter game by enabling a space ship to make decisions by itself through a neural network. The neural network will be taking the observations of asteroid positions and the ship's velocity and then will be proposing possible actions. I will train the network with gradient-free Evolutionary Strategy apporach and track the performance improvement in the API as well.

The plan is to have a desktop application that will be implemented in JavaFX. To this end, I will follow MOOC Ex 14.9 as a starting template for this API:<br />

Wish me luck boys.
